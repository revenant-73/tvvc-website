**8-Week Match Communication Guide (With NAC, ACT, and MI Tools)**

**Purpose:** This guide helps you engage your players meaningfully during pre-match, timeouts, between sets, and post-match conversations. It blends ecological coaching, motivational interviewing (MI), and acceptance and commitment training (ACT) with the NAC method: **Notice, Adjust, Commit**.

TAB 1: Course Overview

 Coaching Foundations Course: From Control to Connection
Subtitle: A Practical Course in Ecological Dynamics, Constraints-Led Coaching, NAC Communication, Motivational Interviewing (MI), and Acceptance & Commitment Training (ACT)

📚 Course Overview
This short but powerful coaching course equips Tualatin Valley Volleyball Club and Century High School coaches with the tools to coach through perception, connection, and intention — not control and correction.

You’ll explore the ecological dynamics framework, the constraints-led approach to training, and the communication methods of NAC, MI, and ACT — all of which are integrated into our match day and seasonal flow. This course is designed for new and returning coaches and will leave you with both the confidence and language to implement our values-based, athlete-centered approach.

TAB 2: MODULE 1

## COACH EDUCATION: CORE FRAMEWORKS

### 🧠 Module 1: Foundations of Ecological Dynamics

**Objective:** Provide coaches with a deep, practical understanding of ecological dynamics so they can design better practices and interact more effectively with athletes throughout the season.

---

### What is Ecological Dynamics?

Ecological Dynamics is a learning and performance framework grounded in systems thinking, motor learning, psychology, and biology. It views each athlete as a dynamic system embedded within a performance environment. Rather than separating technique, decision-making, and emotion, ecological dynamics sees these elements as inseparably linked through **interaction**.

Instead of treating skill as something that can be delivered through verbal instruction or repeated drills, this approach treats learning as **an emergent, adaptive process** — where players learn by solving problems in context.

### Core Concepts Explained

#### 🔗 **Perception-Action Coupling**

This principle says that athletes don’t think first, then act. They act as they perceive. It’s continuous and reciprocal.

> 🏐 *Example: A blocker reads the setter’s hands and adjusts their jump in real time. There’s no internal delay — their perception guides their movement.*

**Implication:** If we remove perception from training (e.g., hitting from a toss with no block), we disconnect players from how the game is actually played.

> 💬 *Interactive Reflection: What drills do you run that include decision-making, deception, or opponent cues? What drills don’t?*

---

#### 🪜 **Affordances**

Affordances are the invitations to act provided by the environment. Skilled players aren’t just athletic — they’re perceptually attuned to more *options*.

> 🏐 *Example: A ball drifting outside the antenna invites a line shot or a tool off the block. A slow set invites a tip. A block that drifts wide opens up the seam.*

**Implication:** Instead of teaching “what to do,” we help players learn how to see what’s available — then trust their own decision.

> 💬 *Question to Try: In a drill, ask players, “What did the court give you on that swing?” or “What did you notice before you passed?”*

---

#### 🧠 **Representative Learning Design**

Representative means that your training environment includes the same types of decisions, timing, pressure, and information as the game.

> 🏐 *Example: In serve receive, players should track the server, adjust spacing, and call seams — not just stand and wait.*

**Checklist for Representativeness:**

* Is there time pressure?
* Is there an opponent?
* Are there consequences for good/bad decisions?
* Are athletes perceiving game-relevant cues?

> 💬 *Audit Challenge: Pick one of your favorite drills. Would it prepare a player for a real match? Why or why not?*

---

#### 🔁 **Movement Variability and Degeneracy**

In this model, variation is not a flaw — it’s the essence of adaptability. "Degeneracy" refers to the ability to achieve the same outcome using different strategies or movements.

> 🏐 *Example: A middle blocker may close the block using a crossover step or a shuffle depending on the set. A passer might use platform angle, step-through, or knee drop — all effective.*

**Implication:** The goal isn’t robotic consistency — it’s reliable adaptability. Encourage exploration, not repetition.

> 💬 *Try This: Praise when a player scores in a new way — “You found a different answer. That’s what we need.”*

---

### Misconceptions to Address

❌ “So there’s no technique?”
✅ Technique is *emergent* — players develop stable solutions through solving problems, not mimicking demos.

❌ “This just means chaos or letting them figure it out.”
✅ Coaches shape the environment, guide attention, and build tasks that **channel discovery** — it’s not hands-off; it’s hands-wise.

❌ “They just need reps.”
✅ Repetition without variation is not learning. **Learning requires variability, attention, and context.**

---

### Translating Theory into Practice

#### 🏐 IN PRACTICE

* Use **small-sided games** to increase touches and problem-solving (e.g., 3v3 on half court with scoring bonuses).
* Modify court space, rules, scoring, or task to highlight specific learning goals.
* Always ask: *“Is this inviting perception, decision, and action?”*

#### 🏐 IN MATCHES

* Use timeouts and between-point conversations to reinforce perception: “What did you see?” “What might be open?”
* Avoid over-coaching mechanics. Focus on helping players interpret information and commit to action.
* Recognize and praise adaptation — not just outcome.

---

### Wrap-Up: Coaching as an Ecological Architect

Your role is not to insert skills into players. It’s to shape environments where the right **problems emerge**, the right **cues become visible**, and the right **solutions can be discovered and repeated**.

The ecological dynamics model doesn’t remove the coach — it redefines coaching as craft.

> ✅ What to do next:
>
> * Re-examine your favorite drills. Are they representative?
> * Try 1 new game that includes time, space, and opponent decisions.
> * Begin asking: “What did you see?” and “What did the game give you?”

**Next Module: Constraints-Led Approach (CLA)** – Learn how to create learning without lectures by manipulating the environment instead of the athlete.
